🛠️ Assembly Language Projects with EMU8086
This repository contains a collection of x86 Assembly Language programs written for the EMU8086 emulator. Whether you're a beginner exploring low-level programming or revisiting the elegance of the 8086 instruction set, these examples are designed to deepen your understanding of hardware-near computation.
📌 Features:
- Well-commented 8086 assembly code
- Classic algorithm implementations (sorting, loops, string manipulation)
- Input/output handling using DOS interrupts
- Use of macros, procedures, and memory segmentation
- Educational focus with beginner-friendly explanations
💡 Requirements:
- EMU8086 Emulator (https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/)
- Basic understanding of x86 architecture and assembly syntax
🚀 Getting Started:
Each project folder includes a .asm file that can be opened and run using the EMU8086 emulator. Step-by-step comments are provided to guide your learning.
